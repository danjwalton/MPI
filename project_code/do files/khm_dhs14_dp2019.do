	the dry season and the sh104b variable captures the  source of drinking 
	water during wet season. Similarly, there is no observation for hv204

	available for the dry season (sh104) and wet season (sh104d). Some 
	30% of the households use different source of water between the dry and wet 
	season. As such we construct the drinking water variable using both

	non-improved source of drinking water in either dry or wet season, as well
