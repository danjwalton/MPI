/* MÃ©xico ENSANUT 2016: 
There are 4 database that we use to compute the Global MPI: 
- HOGAR     : "hogar_integrantes_procesada" and "hogar_socioeconomicoprocesada"
- NUTRITION : "Edo_Nut_AdultoS" and "Edo_Nut_Men_Adol"

There are 2 data files that we use to compute indicators related to nutrition:
https://ensanut.insp.mx/ensanut2016/descarga_bases.php
"Edo_Nut_Adultos" (Adults' nutritional information); and 
"Edo_Nut_Men_Adol" (Teenagers' and under 5 nutritional information)


Anthropometric information is available for individuals aged 0-99 years.*/
